# form
An application that uses MoveNet to give realtime feedback on your lifting form. This app will consider the main compound movements for now. The goal is that this app will have two main components: critiquing lifting form using joint angles and eye positioning; and, counting strict repititions using joint angles. This will have practical applications for any lifter to lift optimally and safely, and the latter goal of the app (strict reps) will be especially useful to powerlifters.
